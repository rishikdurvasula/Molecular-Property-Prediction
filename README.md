# GNN Molecular Property Prediction

## Project Overview
This project develops a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** using **PyTorch Geometric** to predict **molecular properties** from molecular graphs. The model is trained on the **QM9 dataset**, which contains molecular structures and corresponding properties derived from **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** calculations. The goal is to leverage **deep learning and graph-based techniques** to accelerate molecular property prediction, reducing the need for expensive quantum chemistry simulations.

## Purpose
- Predict molecular properties from graph representations of molecules.
- Accelerate material and drug discovery by reducing dependency on computationally expensive simulations.
- Enable scalable and distributed training on **AWS GPU clusters** for improved performance.
